A personâ€™s creditworthiness is often associated (conversely) with the likelihood they may default on loans. 

Anonymized data on about 1000 loan applications has been given, along with a certain set of attributes about the applicant itself, and whether they were considered high risk.
0 = Low credit risk i.e high chance of paying back the loan amount
1 = High credit risk i.e low chance of paying back the loan amount

At first EDA has been done , later Data pre-processsing and modelling has been done.(Logistic regression, support vector classifier and Random Forest algorithms have been tested out)
